# Book Tracker: Organize Your Reading List Effortlessly

## Description

Welcome to Book Tracker, an application designed to help users curate and manage their reading lists with ease. With Book Tracker, users can seamlessly compile a list of books they intend to read.

Adding a new book to the list is simple. Users can utilize the form located at the bottom of the screen to input the title of the book they wish to add. Upon submission, the entered book title will be added to the list of books.

Once users have built their reading list, they have the flexibility to edit or remove books as desired. To delete a book, users can simply click on the "x" icon located at the top right corner of each book card. For editing, users can click on the pencil icon to enable edit mode for individual books. In edit mode, users can modify the title of the book using a text input field and save their changes. Upon saving, the book card will exit edit mode and display the updated title.

As part of our code refactoring process, we'll leverage React's Context feature to enhance the maintainability and scalability of our application. Additionally, we'll transition from local storage to utilizing an external API to store, retrieve, update, and delete book data, offering a more robust and dynamic user experience.
